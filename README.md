I am a Full Stack Software Engineer who enjoys collaboration and problem solving. ü§î Some technologies that I enjoy using includes ReactJS, Javascript, Express and Node.js. At the moment, I am learning more about real-time technologies such as Socket.io. I am also learning Typescript and all of its nuances. Aside from development, I often enjoy video games and going on hikes with my dog. üêï
